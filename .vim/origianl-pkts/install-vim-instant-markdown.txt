Installation

You first need to have Ruby with RubyGems, and node.js with npm installed. (In the future there might be a version which won't require node.js at all, making installation easier)

*********David To fix error encountered in Ubuntu 14.04
Step 0: sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev

[sudo] gem install pygments.rb
If you're using Ruby 1.9.2 or later, [sudo] gem install redcarpet. Otherwise, [sudo] gem install redcarpet -v 2.3.0
[sudo] npm -g install instant-markdown-d
If you're on Linux, the xdg-utils package needs to be installed (is installed by default on Ubuntu).
Copy the after/ftplugin/markdown/instant-markdown.vim file from this repo into your ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown/ (creating directories as necessary), or use pathogen.
Ensure you have the line filetype plugin on in your .vimrc
Open a markdown file in vim and enjoy!
Configuration

g:instant_markdown_slow

By default, vim-instant-markdown will update the display in realtime. If that taxes your system too much, you can specify

let g:instant_markdown_slow = 1
before loading the plugin (for example place that in your ~/.vimrc). This will cause vim-instant-markdown to only refresh on the following events:

No keys have been pressed for a while
A while after you leave insert mode
You save the file being edited
g:instant_markdown_autostart

By default, vim-instant-markdown will automatically launch the preview window when you open a markdown file. If you want to manually control this behavior, you can specify

let g:instant_markdown_autostart = 0
in your .vimrc. You can then manually trigger preview via the command :InstantMarkdownPreview. This command is only available inside markdown buffers and when the autostart option is turned off.
